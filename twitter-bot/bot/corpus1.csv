The King Kong character was conceived and created by American filmmaker Merian C. Cooper. In the original film the character's name is Kong a name given to him by the inhabitants of the fictional "Skull Island" in the Indian Ocean where Kong lives along with other oversized animals such as plesiosaurs pterosaurs and various dinosaurs. An American film crew led by Carl Denham captures Kong and takes him to New York City to be exhibited as the "Eighth Wonder of the World".  Kong escapes and climbs the Empire State Building only to fall from the skyscraper after being attacked by airplanes with guns. Denham comments "it wasn't the airplanes It was beauty killed the beast" for he climbs the building in the first place only in an attempt to protect Ann Darrow an actress originally offered up to Kong on Skull Island as a sacrifice (in the 1976 remake her character is named "Dwan").  A pseudo-documentary about Skull Island that appears on the DVD for the 2005 remake (originally seen on the Sci-Fi Channel.
