In his first appearance in King Kong (1933) Kong was a gigantic prehistoric ape or as RKO's publicity materials described him "A prehistoric type of ape".[32] While gorilla-like in appearance he had a vaguely humanoid look and at times walked upright in an anthropomorphic manner. Indeed Carl Denham describes him as being "neither beast nor man".  Like most simians Kong possesses semi-human intelligence and great physical strength. Kong's size changes drastically throughout the course of the film. While creator Merian C. Cooper envisioned Kong as being "40 to 50 feet tall"[33] animator Willis O'Brien and his crew built the models and sets scaling Kong to be only 18 feet (5.5 m) tall on Skull Island and rescaled to be 24 feet (7.3 m) tall in New York.[34]  This did not stop Cooper from playing around with Kong's size as he directed the special effect sequences; by manipulating the sizes of the miniatures and the camera angles he made Kong appear a lot larger than O'Brien wanted even as large as 60 fee.
